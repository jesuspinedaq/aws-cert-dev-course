Lecture 4: Loadbalancing

ELB
	AWS managed load balancer (, or can be used self managed one)
	types:
		classic, v1 - old generation 2009
		application load balancer, v2 - new gen 2016
		network load balancer, v2 - new gen 2017

Health checks
	which node are up

Application Load Balancer v2 (HTTP/HTTPS/Websocket)
	Standin between client and EC2
	usage:
		multiple http application across machines (target groups)
		multiple application on same machines (containers)
		...
	dynamic port mapping
	stickiness (ALB level, not application)
	support: HTTP/HTTPS/Websocket
	X-Forwarded-For/X-Forwarded-Proto - IP of client
	good with ECS - Elastic Container Service (Docker)

Network Load Balancer v2 (TCP)
	Similar to ALB
	high thoughput
	does not see client IP

Classic Load Balancer - deprecated
	
All load balancer:
	has static host name
	can scale, but not immidiatelly

Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
	add/remove instances (scale out/in)
	min/desired/max
	auto scaling alarm (all type of metrics)
	ASG free

EBS volume
	network drive
	locked to Availability Zone (AZ)
	can be moved with snapshots
	types: GP2 (SSD), IOI (SSD), STI (HDD), SCI (HDD)
	volume can be increased
	snapshot only contain the data, not the full drive
	encryption: rest, encrypt-in-flight, snapshots encrypted, volumes created from snapshots also encrypted, minimal impact on latency, KMS (AES-256)
	attach to only 1 node at a time

Instance Store
	physically attached to machine
	no root EBS volume
	better IO perfomance
	termination store is wiped
	no resize
	no backup support, only manually
