Lecture 9 - CICD:

AWS CodeCommit - store code, like Github
AWS CodePipeline - automated pipeline from code to EB
AWS CodeBuild - build and test the code, like Jenkins
AWS CodeDeploy - deploy code to EC2 (not EB)

CI: code push, build & test code, feedback (find & fix bug early, deliver faster, deploy often)
CD: deployment can happen automcatically often & fast

CodeCommit and CodeBuild can be switch with 3rd party application (Jenkins,..)

CodeCommit:
	Managed version control
	Authentication: ssh keys, https (cli creds or new https creds), MFA
	Authorization: IAM policies
	Automatic encryption with KMS
	Cross Account access: IAM Role, AWS STS with AssumeRole API
	vs Github:
		Github Users vs AWS IAM users & roles
		Hosted by Github/Self-hosting vs AWS
		UI is better for Github
	Notification: 
		could be complex, like analyse code, etc..
		AWS CloudWatch Event Rules - PR events, Repo management events
		Triggers: AWS SNS, AWS Lambda - branch events, push to branch

CodePipeline:
	Orchestration & continuos delivery
	Works with artifacts (AWS S3)
		source output artifacts from CodeCommit
		build output artifacts from CodeBuild
	Troubleshooting
		pipeline state change creates a AWS CloudWatch event, which can create a SNS notification
		failure stops pipeline, information on console
		AWS CloudTrail can audit AWS API calls
		Pipeline usually need some IAM Role, these needs to be checked
	Stages have multiple ActionGroups
	ActionGroups have multiple Actions
	Action are executed paralel ?
