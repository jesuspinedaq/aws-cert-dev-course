Lecture 9 - CICD:

AWS CodeCommit - store code, like Github
AWS CodePipeline - automated pipeline from code to EB
AWS CodeBuild - build and test the code, like Jenkins
AWS CodeDeploy - deploy code to EC2 (not EB)

CI: code push, build & test code, feedback (find & fix bug early, deliver faster, deploy often)
CD: deployment can happen automcatically often & fast

CodeCommit and CodeBuild can be switch with 3rd party application (Jenkins,..)

CodeCommit:
	Managed version control
	Authentication: ssh keys, https (cli creds or new https creds), MFA
	Authorization: IAM policies
	Automatic encryption with KMS
	Cross Account access: IAM Role, AWS STS with AssumeRole API
	vs Github:
		Github Users vs AWS IAM users & roles
		Hosted by Github/Self-hosting vs AWS
		UI is better for Github
	Notification: 
		could be complex, like analyse code, etc..
		AWS CloudWatch Event Rules - PR events, Repo management events
		Triggers: AWS SNS, AWS Lambda - branch events, push to branch

CodePipeline:
	Orchestration & continuos delivery
	Works with artifacts (AWS S3)
		source output artifacts from CodeCommit
		build output artifacts from CodeBuild
	Troubleshooting
		pipeline state change creates a AWS CloudWatch event, which can create a SNS notification
		failure stops pipeline, information on console
		AWS CloudTrail can audit AWS API calls
		Pipeline usually need some IAM Role, these needs to be checked
	Stages have multiple ActionGroups
	ActionGroups have multiple Actions
	Action are executed paralel ?

CodeBuild:
	Building and testing application
	Fully managed build service: continuos scaling, no server to manage, no build queue
	Pay only for usage
	Leverages Docker for reproducible builds - builds running container first
		possible to create base Docker image to build
	Containers are deleted at the end of their execution (success or failed)
	Integrate with Github, CodeCommit, ...
	Build instruction: /buildspec.yml
	Output log to S3 & CloudWatch
	Metrics to monitor build statistics
	CloudWatch Alarms, CloudWatch Events, AWS Lambda as a Glue (?), SNS notification
	buildspec.yml
		pull parameters from environemnt - SSM Parameter Store
		phases: install dependencies, pre-build, execute build commands, post-build
	output artifact encrypted with KMS
	can use cache to speed up dependencies fetch
	can run build locally with CodeBuild Agent, have access to all logs and more ..

CodeDeploy:
	Managed service, goal is automatic deploy to multiple EC2 that not managed by EB
	3rd party options: Ansible, Terraform, Chef, Puppet
	all EC2 must be running CodeDeploy Agent
	EC2 instances are grouped
	Can be chained into CodePipeline
	/appspec.yml will be polled by EC2 instances
		file section: how to source and copy from S3/GitHub
		hooks: instructions to deploy, order is (mostly optional):
			ApplicationStop
			DownloadBundle
			BeforeInstall
			AfterInstall
			ApplicationStart
			ValidateService
	Failed deploy leaves instances in failed state

CodeStar:
	Integration solution for all AWS CICD services
	Issue tracking: JIRA, Github Issues
	Free service, only paying for underlying services
