Lecture 5:

Route 53
	Managed DNS
	rules and record that help to identify server thorugh URL
	Record types
		A - URL to IPv4
		AAAA - URL to IPv6
		CNAME - URL to URL
		Alias - URL to AWS resource (prefered over CNAME)
	public vs private domain (resolve only in VPC)

Relational Database Service (RDS)
	Managed service
	continuos backup (daily full backup, transaction log in real time, 7-35 day retention), also manual snapshot
	restore support (any time)
	monitoring dashboard
	read replicas (max 5?), async replication, can be promoted, connection string changes
	multi AZ (disaster recovery), sync replication, only 1 DNS active for failover
	scaling (vertical and horizontal)
	no SSH into machine
	rest capability encryption
	ssl cert to in-flight encrption
	ssl can be enforced, need db script
	
ElastiCache
	Managed caching
	Redis (key-value persistent) and Memcached (object-based non-persistent)
	write scaling - sharding
	read scaling - read replicas
	multi AZ failover
	other features (monitoring, ...)

ElastiCache patterns
	caching is good for read-heavy apps & compute-intensive workload
	Lazy-loading
	WriteThrough - write cache when add/update/delete data

Virtual private cloud (VPC)
 	contains subnets that mapped to AZ
 	public/private subnets
 	VPC flow log
 	VPCs are account per region
