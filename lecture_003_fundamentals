Lecture: ~20h -> full course with practice: ~40h -> daily 1:30h / 3 days a week -> 9 week -> deadline: Oct. 1


Fundamentals:

AWS Regions:
	us-east-1a, us-east-1b, eu-central-1a
		-> a/b is availability zones (AZ) (separated zones, min 3 data center)
	console is region zoned
	Global scoped services, pl: IAM
	! mine: EU (Frankfurt)

IAM - identity and access manager
	user, groups, roles
	root account (should not be used later)
	services calls IAM for authentication/authorization (?)
	policies are in JSON

	user - for physical person
	groups - function/teams grouping of users
	roles - internal usage within AWS resources, for machines

	Global view
	MFA possible
	predefined policies
	least privilege priciples

	IAM Federation - company auth, SAML

	1 user per person
	1 role per application
	root account only for initial setup

EC2
	virtual machines EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
	data storage/volume EBS (Elastic Block Storage)
	load distribution ELB (Elastic Load Balancing)
	scaling services/groups ASG (Auto Scaling Groups)
	AMI - amazon machine image (specific for region)

Security Groups
	Controls in/out -bound traffic
	EC2 firewall
	Outside firewall, instance not seeing blocked inbound traffic
	Locked to region
	Default: all inbound is blocked, all outbound is allowed
	Security group can be referenced by other sec. group or by itself

Elastic IP
	public IPv4, only for 1 instance until released
		-> public IP is otherwise lost on restart

EC2 User Data
	bootstrap machine at first start
	runs with root user
example:
	#!/bin/bash
	yum update -y
	yum install -y httpd.x86_64
	systemctl start httpd.service
	systemctl enable httpd.service
	echo "Hello world from $(hostname -f)" > /var/www/html/index.html

EC2 Instance Launch types
	- On demand - short workload
	- Reserved - long workload
	- Converible - long workload with flexible instances
	- Scheduled reserved - for example weekly instance
	- Spot - cheap, can lose instance, 2 min notification
	- Dedicated - only 1 customer on 1 hardware
	- Dedicated Host - entire server for 1 customer, instance placement

EC2 Pricing
	per hour based on: (first minute is billed by second)
		- region
		- instance type
		- launch type
		- OS type
		- IP, other nwetwork features

EC2 Types: > 50 types based around: RAM, CPU, I/O, Network, GPU
	M - balanced (np GPU)
	R/C/P/.. - specialized
	T2/T3 - burstable (short big load handling, uses CPU credit)
	T2 unlimited - no loose perfomance, but billed
